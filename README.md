This project was created for SDEV300 class at UMGC.
The purpose of the project was to show case the ability to create secure python programs using Flask.
This website was designed to allow user to create logins and passwords and compare the passwords to a list of commonly used passwords.

Future state of the project may include a functioning database of the user's golf scores and dynamic tracking of the handicap.
This would require a database of golf courses as well for the calculation of the handicap.
